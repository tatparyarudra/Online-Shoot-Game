## 🎯 Why I Built This

I created this project as a personal challenge to dive into the world of **network programming**, **real-time synchronization**, and **multiplayer game logic**.  
The project helped me explore threading, sockets, and handling multiple active players — all while keeping the gameplay fun and interactive.

This game was entirely coded for **fun** and **learning**, combining programming with creativity!
